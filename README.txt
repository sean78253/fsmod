Food Service Monitoring on a budget
Thought here is to use Raspberry Pi's to taack information for Food Service operations on tempatures and refrigation health.
If temps go out of profile, alert.
If voltatages go out of profile, alert.
If a system fails to report in, alert.

Note: This project is maintained but the code has gone non-public aside from what you see here.
